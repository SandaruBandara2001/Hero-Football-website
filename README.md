To summarize, the requirements for the form on your website are as follows:

Input fields: The form should include input fields for users to enter their name and email address.
Textarea: There should be a textarea where users can enter the details of their query.
Query Theme Selection: Users should be able to select the theme of their query from a minimum of three subjects. This can be done using radio buttons or a select dropdown.
View Query Button: When the "View Query" button is clicked, JavaScript should be used to check if the compulsory fields (name, email address, query subject, and query details) are filled in. If any of these fields are missing, an alert message should be displayed indicating which fields are missing.
Displaying Query Summary: If all the required fields are filled in, the form should disappear, and the submitted information should be displayed on the page using the innerHTML property. The displayed summary should include the name, email address, query subject, and query details. Additionally, two new buttons, "Edit" and "Send," should be included.
Edit Button: When the "Edit" button is clicked, the displayed details should disappear, and the initial form should reappear with the previously entered information filled in.
Send Button: If the user clicks the "Send" button, the displayed details should disappear, and the form should be sent by email.
Please note that the implementation of the form and its functionalities will require programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
